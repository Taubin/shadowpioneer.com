## What is this? A change to a different platform?

So I've decide to give Hugo a try for my main blogging platform. There are numerous reasons for this, mostly cost involved. I'll be able to move all of my sites from an expensive VM, to cheap AWS buckets. 

As for this site, for now at least, it's actually going to be hosted on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com). At least for now. 

There are a lot of changes to be made, and a lot of learning, however it should be a fun experience. Hopefully you enjoy it as much as I do. 

Cheers
